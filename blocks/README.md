- `core` - overrides for output of WordPress core blocks
- `custom` - overrides for output of blocks added via my fork of the Gutenberg plugin
- `doublee` - blocks added in this theme.

General idea is that this theme does not require a build step other than compiling SCSS. Blocks with sufficient
complexity in the editor to require a JavaScript build step are added through my version of the plugin.
